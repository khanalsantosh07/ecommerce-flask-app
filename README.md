Assignment 02: E-Commerce Flask Application

Objective: In this assignment, you will create a Flask web application with two routes:

- a homepage (/) and,
- a products page (/products).

The application will connect to a MongoDB Atlas database to fetch and display product
information, which includes a productâ€™s name, tag, price, and image path (local to the
Flask app). You will use Jinja2 templates to create dynamic content and Bootstrap for
styling the product page
